The database was developed using Ruby on Rails, is open source, and can be found at [Github](https://github.com/jmadin/traits2). The foundation for this web application (e.g., session and user models) was developed using Michael Hartl's Ruby on Rails tutorial.

> Basically, if you enter data into the database and make it public, the data can be reused by others if they cite it correctly. Similarly, if you download and use data in an analysis to be published, you must cite primary (and, if applicable, secondary) resources correctly.

A couple of key points:

- Content must be associated with a published scientific or other scholarly research document
- Content may only be entered by an individual who represents and warrants that s/he is the creator and owner of the content or otherwise has sufficient rights to be able to make the
content available under a [CC0 Waiver](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)
- The primary language of the content must be English.
- Once CC0 is applied by making data public and associating it with a published research Document, the data can not be made private again.
